## Paragraph Version

Hi, I am Daniel Reinagel.

As long as I remember I've been exposed to coding in some form or another. My dad and couple brothers of mine are coders. After working my first job in retail, I felt I needed something more.

Now I'm searching for a company I can empower with my ability to identify and solve problems in existing code bases, my ability to quickly learn new tools and skills, and most of all, my ability to work under and support a team in the ways they request, not just the ways I believe would be most useful. 

I'm interested in web development because I'll regularly have fascinating challenges. Solving puzzles is something I find immensely gratifying. I'll be given opportunities to create, which allows me to explore what can be done and test those limits! And finally, I'll be able to see our team's work become a powerful tool to serve others.
