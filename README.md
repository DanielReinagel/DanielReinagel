Hi, I am Daniel Reinagel.

As long as I remember I've been exposed to coding in some form or another. My dad and couple brothers of mine are coders. After working my first job in retail, I felt I needed something more.

When I decided to seek a new path, coding came to mind quickly. I decided to join the Lambda School program (now called BloomTech) mostly because a brother of mine recommended it. Once I started, coding came very naturally to me.

I have liked the coding experience and figuring out how to get functions to return what I want to return or do what I want them to do. I am looking forward to the opportunity to use my skills to contribute meaningfully to a development team.
